You can choose from many available male and female voices. You can also set the pitch of the voice and the reading speed. Supports PDF. Supports EPUB (via the excellent EPUBReader extension).\n\nRead Aloud is a Firefox extension that uses text-to-speech technology to convert webpage text to audio. It works on a variety of websites, including news sites, blogs, fan fiction, publications, textbooks, school and class websites, online universities and course materials.\n\nRead Aloud is aimed at users who prefer to listen to content instead of reading, people with dyslexia or other learning disabilities, children learning to read, or simply to provide users with alternative way to consume web content.\n\nRead Aloud allows you to select from a variety of text-to-speech voices, including those provided natively by the browser, as well as by text-to-speech cloud service providers such as Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson, and Microsoft. Some of the cloud-based voices may require additional in-app purchase to enable.\n\nRecent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence has enabled very high-quality speech synthesis. Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly voices, for example, use bleeding edge technology to provide life-like synthetic speech that is close to that of human speech. Read Aloud allows you to use your own Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services account to enable these voices.\n\nTo use Read Aloud, simply navigate to the web page you want to read, then click the Read Aloud icon on the Firefox menu. In addition, the shortcut keys ALT-P, ALT-O, ALT-Comma, and ALT-Period can be used to Play/Pause, Stop, Rewind, and Forward, respectively. You may select the text you want to read before activating the extension. Right clicking on the selected text will provide you with yet another context-menu option to activate Read Aloud.\n\nTo change the voice, reading speed, pitch, or enable text highlighting, go to the Options page either by right clicking on the Read Aloud icon and choose Options, or by clicking the Gear button on the extension popup (you'll need to stop playback to see the Gear button).\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nPersonal information\nIf you use one of the Premium Voices, you'll be asked to sign in to your Google account and grant Read Aloud access to your basic user profile, which includes name and email address. We require this information for usage tracking, since the Premium Voices requires making a purchase when usage exceeds the monthly free tier. If you don't use the Premium Voices, you don't need to sign in, and no information is collected.\n\nBrowsing history\nWe do not track the user's browsing history. We realize the importance of privacy, so we make sure our extensions require only the minimum set of browser permissions to operate. In particular, during installation, it does not ask for the \"Read your browsing history\" or the \"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\" permissions, both of which could be used to track the user's browsing history.\n\nText converted to speech\nWhen you select one of the standard text-to-speech voices, the speech synthesis occurs locally on your computer and is never sent to the internet. And neither the input text nor the synthesized speech are saved or stored on your computer.\n\nWhen you select one of the premium text-to-speech voices, the input text is sent to our cloud server for synthesis. The server may use your anonymized IP address and User-Agent data for purpose of analytics, abuse management, and service improvement. The server may cache the input text, as well as the synthesized speech, for short amounts of time as part of its normal operation; it does not save them to any type of permanent storage.\n\nGeolocation\nIf you select a voice that is synthesized on our server, your anonymized IP address may be used for geolocation for analytics purposes.\n\nIssue reporting and contact forms\nIf you use the in-app report-issue function or use the contact form on our support website, your comments and information may be kept in our support database for a maximum of 6 months.\n\nAnalytics\nThe extensions use Firefox Addons Store's built-in analytics. Firefox will collect basic extension usage data, including when the extension is installed, invoked, and uninstalled. The extension may also use its own counters to analyze usage patterns.

The only permissions I ask for are \"tabs\" to insert the functionality and \"storage\" to store your settings. I am a strong believer in privacy.

As a result we are inundated with tasty thumbnails and advertisements from every angle. While this is good for someone looking to kill time, it's not so good for those of us intending to focus on educational content, do research, or simply find some relaxing music to groove to.\n\nAfter using DF YouTube for a few days, you realize the extent to which the pattern of click, watch, scan mindlessly for a new video, click, watch, and repeat, has been ingrained in us by YouTube's design. DF YouTube breaks that cycle.\n\nBy default, DF YouTube hides the video recommendations sidebar as well as the related videos that appear at the end of videos. It also removes the grid of recommended videos that appear on your homepage. These settings are all configurable. It can also hide comments and disable playlists sitewide.\n\nI hope DF YouTube allows you to focus on the content *you* want to focus on.

Blocking images results in faster browsing, especially helpful on handheld devices or slower connections.","fullDescription":"Updated to work with newer versions! This version had to be completely re-written as the new APIs are much more restrictive.\n\nDescription of earlier version below -\n\nThis addon first showed up in 2007 for Firefox version 1.5. Since then its has tried to support all Firefox versions (absolute legacy support), even if it meant compromising on some features (e.g. toolbar button, which is finally movable now). The last thing I wanted was for a user to change there installation just for Image Block to work.\n\nAnother key issue that everyone kept pointing (other than the immovable button) was images not being blocked on certain sites (e.g. Google Image search). This was done on purpose, as these images are embedded in data, \"blocking\" them was not possible. They could only be \"hidden\", which would not help in faster browsing or less data use. However, I have finally added this (I'm still not fully convinced if this is the way to go).\n\nThen there were (are) the endless demands of black-lists, white-lists, conditional blocking, flash, tab specific, auto reload, blocking content other than images... so on and so forth. Well, I don't plan to do any of that. The whole idea is to keep it simple, so that everyone can use it... even my mom! Its easy to make tons of buttons and give every feature possible to the user, but making everything work with a single button sets the user free. Most human beings like simple tools!\n\nLast version was released for Firefox 3.5, it worked till now without any changes to code.\n\nBelow is the original description (last edited in 2010!)\n\nImage Block adds a toggle button that conditionally blocks/allows loading of images on webpages. The toggle button is added to the navigation toolbar (extreme right) by default. Blocking images results in faster browsing, especially helpful on handheld devices or slower connections like GSM/GPRS/EDGE dial-up etc.\n\nRecently in a review one user (thanks dellvin!) pointed out that Image Block is quite useful when you visit websites which show dirty and adult advertisements, while also containing useful information. If you are not sure of what you are about to see on a webpage, just block images to avoid possible embarrassment.\n\nIt can also be used at work where your boss doesn't allow you to surf the web or social networking websites!! They look very different (hard to see which site you are viewing) with image blocking on.\n\n- Version 2.1 fixes a couple of bugs, adds tooltip and french language ( thanks to Vincent Caron for this update).\n- Version 2.0 fixes compatibility issues with Firefox 3.5, it also adds the button to the navigation toolbar by default.\n\nVery simple image blocking extension, hopefully useful!\n\nThis is my the first extension, I always try to \"Keep It Simple, Stupid\"","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/208/208523.png?modified=1622132167","width":1400,"height":770,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/208/208523.jpg?modified=1622132167","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":293,"caption":"Works

And it can map a same key sequence to different commands for different websites (and/or for different active elements in page).\n\nFor example:\n* press `f` to hint all clickable elements of the current web page\n* press `o` to show a search panel (\"Vomnibar\", a safe iframe) to search in your history, bookmarks, opened tabs and configured search engines, and you can even remove a history or tab by selecting a search result and pressing Shift+Delete\n* press j, k, h, l to scroll down/up/left/right on web pages\n* press \"/\" to search for text; press \"v\" to enter Visual Mode (just like VIM)\n* press Shift+J, Shift+K, `g0`, `g$` to switch to the previous/next/first/last tab\n* press `x` to remove a tab, and Shift+X to restore recently closed tabs (sessions), and many other commands\n* command repetition: for example, pressing `5X` (`5`, Shift+X) will restore 5 recent closed tabs\n* configure key mappings to bind Vimium C's tens of commands to other key sequences, and add options to switch command behaviors\n* apply block lists and allow lists of key mappings on configurable special websites and URLs\n\nIt can copy any selected text and current tab's title and URL to the system clipboard, and read the clipboard to search the copied text using a specified search engine.\n\nIt can also enable/disable websites' image loading and even JavaScript execution, if you trigger its command \"toggleCS\". This functionality requires a permission of \"Change your settings that control websites' access to features such as cookies, JavaScript ...\", and Vimium C promises that it won't do any thing secretly, but only act on what key sequences you press.\n\nIt will provide 8 \"global\" browser shortcuts: createTab, previousTab, nextTab, reloadTab, and some others, so you may bind some key sequences to them, and then these commands will work even when a page has no focus (e.g. when the browser address bar is focused).\n\nIt will register an omnibox keyword \"v\", and if you input \"v\" and press Space on the browser address bar (omnibox), you can do searches for history, bookmarks and tabs just like you're inputting on its Vomnibar.\n\nIt supports encoded URLs, and you can search Chinese, Japanese and Korean words in URLs of history and bookmarks. You may configure it to decode URLs in a charset of your locale .\n\nIt will download all synced settings from the Internet during the first installation, and you may enable/disable the syncing on certain computers.\n\nIf you have any exclusion rule for key mappings, it will monitor browser tab URL changes to re-check whether a new URL matches your URL pattern list.\n\nVimium C may show a notification when it gets upgraded to a new minor version.\n\nFor more information about release notes, rebinding your keys and how to use many of Vimium C's features, please see here: https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#readme , or https://gitee.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#git-readme .
